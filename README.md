# videoDMD
Dynamic Mode Decomposition of a video and interpolation in matlab.

Quick note: The interpolation is not ideal, and in the future I plan on learning 
a bit more about interpolation to iron out the issues. However for now, it does work
somewhat well and breaks down the video, interpolates between frames and rebuilds it.
